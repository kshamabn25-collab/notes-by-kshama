    <h1>Programme Lessons (Finance)</h1>
    <p>
      These lessons are written for programme leaders, PMOs, and delivery teams who work in environments
      where customer harm is not an acceptable learning method.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Governance design is not the same as governance behaviour</h2>
    <p>
      A programme can have committees, stage gates, and stop authority on paper —
      and still proceed with unresolved readiness gaps if culture rewards “on-time” over “safe”.
    </p>

    <h2>2) “Done” must mean outcomes, not activities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Activity metric: “Testing complete”</li>
      <li>Outcome metric: “Peak customer journeys pass with evidence and monitoring proof”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If reporting focuses on completion, teams learn to hide uncertainty.
      If reporting focuses on outcomes, teams are allowed to say “not yet”.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Operational readiness is a deliverable</h2>
    <p>
      Branches, contact centres, and incident triage need the same rigour as platform delivery:
      simulations, surge planning, scripts, escalation, and daily briefings in the final phase.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Rollback is not pessimism — it is resilience</h2>
    <p>
      A rollback plan only exists when it has been rehearsed, timeboxed, and decision rights are explicit.
      Otherwise, it is documentation, not safety.
    </p>

    <h2>5) In finance, “customer impact” is the true KPI</h2>
    <p>
      When things go wrong, the question is not “who made a mistake?”
      The question is: “what guardrail failed to protect customers?”
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The strongest programmes are not the ones that never hit risk.
      They are the ones that stay honest when risk shows up.
