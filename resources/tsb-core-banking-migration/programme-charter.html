    <h1>Core Banking Migration – Programme Charter</h1>
    <p>
      This charter is written to show how a high-risk financial transformation can be framed with clarity:
      outcomes, guardrails, governance, and “stop” authority defined before delivery pressure peaks.
    </p>

    <div class="disclaimer-box">
      <h2>Important note</h2>
      <p>
        This document is an educational reconstruction based on public context. It is not an internal charter.
        Where assumptions are made, they are stated explicitly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Programme purpose</h2>
    <table class="pm-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <td>
          Migrate customer accounts, transaction history, and servicing channels from a legacy core banking platform
          to a new platform, ensuring customer access, accuracy, payments continuity, and regulatory compliance.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Why it matters</th>
        <td>
          In retail banking, service continuity is trust. A core migration is not “IT go-live” —
          it is a customer safety event requiring operational resilience.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>2) Scope</h2>
    <table class="pm-table">
      <tr>
        <th>In scope</th>
        <td>
          Data migration (accounts/transactions), digital channels (online/mobile), branch servicing,
          payment rails/standing orders, monitoring and incident response, customer communications, stabilization support.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Out of scope</th>
        <td>
          New product launches during cutover window; non-essential enhancements; broad process redesign beyond readiness needs.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>3) Non-negotiables (finance-grade)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers can access funds and accounts reliably post-migration</li>
      <li>Balances and transaction history remain accurate and reconciled</li>
      <li>Payments (direct debits/standing orders/transfers) execute correctly</li>
      <li>Monitoring + incident response operate at “surge” capacity</li>
      <li>Regulatory obligations and audit trails are maintained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Success measures</h2>
    <table class="pm-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Day 1 indicators</th>
        <td>Login success rate, payment success rate, incident severity count, reconciliation pass rate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Week 1 indicators</th>
        <td>Complaint volume vs baseline, contact-centre wait times, backlog burn-down, error rates trending down</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Stabilization exit</th>
        <td>System stability sustained, customer impact normalized, operational load within baseline thresholds</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>5) Delivery approach</h2>
    <table class="pm-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <td>Hybrid programme governance (stage gates + assurance) with iterative testing and rehearsals</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Cutover strategy</th>
        <td>Planned cutover with strict Go/No-Go criteria, war-room operations, and rollback plan rehearsals</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Cadence</th>
        <td>Weekly steering, daily cutover readiness standups in final phase, continuous risk review</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>6) Governance & decision rights</h2>
    <table class="pm-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Steering Committee</th>
        <td>Owns strategic decisions, risk appetite, and external stakeholder alignment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Go/No-Go Board</th>
        <td>Approves cutover only when objective readiness evidence is met</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Stop authority</th>
        <td>
          Programme leadership can recommend No-Go without penalty when readiness gates are not met.
          (Assumption: Stop authority is defined in governance terms and expected to be respected.)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Audit trail</th>
        <td>Decision log maintained for readiness sign-offs, exceptions, and risk acceptances</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>7) Key assumptions (explicit)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Programme deadlines may be influenced by separation/commercial constraints</li>
      <li>Status reporting can drift toward “milestones complete” unless rebalanced to “outcomes proven”</li>
      <li>Operational readiness (branches/contact centre) must be treated as a core deliverable</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      A banking cutover is not a project milestone.
      It is a controlled risk event.
    </blockquote>
