            <h2>Scoring Model</h2>
            <p>
                Risks are scored using a 1–5 scale for Probability (P) and Impact (I). Inherent risk reflects the
                pre-mitigation exposure. Residual risk reflects expected exposure after mitigation and controls.
                Scores are reviewed on cadence and escalated through Steering if residual exposure remains high.
