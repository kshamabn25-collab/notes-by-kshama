    <h1>How to read and use these resources</h1>

    <div class="disclaimer-box">
      <h2>Core intent</h2>
      <p>
        The documents and pages under Resources are shared for <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>portfolio demonstration</strong>.
        They show how I structure project management artifacts — charters, risk registers, delivery plans, and governance notes —
        in a way that’s readable and practically usable.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Educational case study:</strong> When real initiatives are referenced, the material is written as an educational case study based on public context.</li>
        <li><strong>Assumptions may exist:</strong> Numbers such as timelines, budgets, team sizes, targets, and outcomes may be simulated to demonstrate PM structure.</li>
        <li><strong>No affiliation:</strong> These pages do not represent any government body, client, employer, or partner organisation.</li>
        <li><strong>No confidential information:</strong> No proprietary, client-identifiable, or sensitive operational data is included.</li>
        <li><strong>Not advice:</strong> This is not legal, financial, or compliance advice. Validate requirements independently before real-world use.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:12px;">
        Transparency is part of the point. If you reuse a template or structure from this site, keep this disclaimer attached.
