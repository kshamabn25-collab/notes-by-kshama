      <h2>Assumptions note</h2>
      <p>
        The numbers and breakdowns here are illustrative. This page is meant to show <strong>how</strong> to communicate cost and resourcing
        in a case study — clearly, with governance and control points.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>1) Resourcing model</h1>
    <p>
      A clean resourcing view answers three questions:
      <strong>Who is needed?</strong> <strong>When?</strong> and <strong>What are they responsible for?</strong>
    </p>

<div class="table-wrap">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Workstream / role</th>
          <th>Typical allocation</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Delivery Lead / PM</td>
          <td>1.0 FTE</td>
          <td>Plan, RAID, governance cadence, dependency control, stakeholder rhythm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Product Owner</td>
          <td>0.8–1.0 FTE</td>
          <td>Scope, backlog, acceptance criteria, release priorities</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tech Lead / Architect</td>
          <td>1.0 FTE</td>
          <td>Architecture decisions, integration approach, cross-team technical alignment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Engineering</td>
          <td>3–6 FTE</td>
          <td>App + backend/API integration + lifecycle hardening</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>UX / Research</td>
          <td>1–2 FTE</td>
          <td>Journey mapping, accessibility-first design, usability testing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>QA / Test</td>
          <td>1–3 FTE</td>
          <td>Automation, regression, UAT support, release sign-off readiness</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Security / Privacy</td>
          <td>0.5–1.0 FTE</td>
          <td>DPIA, security gates, pen testing coordination, compliance readiness</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change & Communications</td>
          <td>0.5–1.0 FTE</td>
          <td>Adoption planning, citizen guidance, stakeholder updates</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

    <h2>2) Cost model (structure first, numbers second)</h2>
    <p>
      I like to present costs in a way that makes governance easy: clear categories + a review rhythm.
      Even when numbers are unknown, the structure can be defined.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Cost line</th>
          <th>What it typically includes</th>
          <th>Control approach</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>People</td>
          <td>Internal allocation + contractors</td>
          <td>Monthly forecast vs actual, resourcing approval thresholds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cloud / Infrastructure</td>
          <td>Environments, scaling, monitoring, storage</td>
          <td>Spend dashboards, alerts, quarterly optimisation reviews</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tools & Licenses</td>
          <td>Dev/test tools, analytics, workflow tools</td>
          <td>License rationalisation, approvals for new tools</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Security & Compliance</td>
          <td>Audits, pen tests, assurance work</td>
          <td>Gate-based approvals, documented sign-offs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change & Adoption</td>
          <td>Comms, onboarding, training materials</td>
          <td>Rollout plan + KPI tracking + feedback loops</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Contingency</td>
          <td>Unknowns, remediation, unplanned spikes</td>
          <td>Only released via change control</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3) What I would show in a steering update</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Forecast vs actual:</strong> current month + next two months, with variance reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>Top cost drivers:</strong> what changed (scope, resourcing, infra demand).</li>
      <li><strong>Change control summary:</strong> approved changes and their cost/time impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost risks:</strong> risks that can turn into spend (security remediation, performance, compliance delays).</li>
      <li><strong>Decision asks:</strong> what leadership needs to decide this month.</li>
    </ul>

      The goal isn’t “perfect estimates.” The goal is controlled reality: visibility, choices, and early correction.
