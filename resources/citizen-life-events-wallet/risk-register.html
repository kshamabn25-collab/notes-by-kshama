      <h2>Assumptions note</h2>
      <p>
        This register is shared as a sample portfolio artifact. The risk set, scoring, and roles are illustrative and meant to show structure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Risk assessment approach</h1>
    <p>
      Risks are scored using a simple matrix: <strong>Impact (1–5)</strong> × <strong>Likelihood (1–5)</strong>.
      The goal isn’t to predict perfectly — it’s to create visibility early enough to act.
    </p>

    <h2>Review cadence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly RAID review for delivery-level risks and dependencies.</li>
      <li>Escalation to programme board for red risks or material delivery impact.</li>
      <li>Every risk has an owner and a next action — not just a description.</li>
