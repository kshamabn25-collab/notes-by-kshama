    <h1>Hi, I’m Kshama</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve spent years navigating projects, products, and PMO operations. Along the way, I’ve collected lessons, 
      stories, and reflections that rarely make it into slides or dashboards. This blog is where I share them.

    <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
    <p>
      “Notes by Kshama” is my attempt to capture moments that shaped how I think, lead, and learn.
      From meetings that taught me patience to challenges that taught me resilience, each story is 
      an invitation to learn quietly, reflect deeply, and see project management — and life — differently.
