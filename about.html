    <h2>Why this blog exists</h2>
    <p>
      Over time, I realised that some experiences don’t fit neatly into
      resumes, presentations, or social media captions.
      They sit quietly in the background — shaping how we think, speak,
      lead, and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      This space exists to hold those experiences.
      Not as polished advice, but as honest stories — written slowly,
      after reflection.

    <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
    <p>
      This blog is organised around three broad threads that keep
      weaving through my life.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Work & Craft</strong> — stories from my professional journey:
        project management, PMO realities, navigating ambiguity,
        and learning the craft behind consistent delivery.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Voice & Leadership</strong> — lessons from Toastmasters,
        teaching Samskrita, mentoring, and discovering leadership
        without formal authority.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Life, Slowly</strong> — reflections from everyday life:
        food, philosophy, quiet observations, and moments that
        deserve a pause.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to read these notes</h2>
    <p>
      These are not how-to articles or definitive guides.
      They are closer to journal entries — written with clarity,
      but without urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t need to read everything.
      Pick a story, spend time with it, and leave the rest for another day.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="story">
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I work in project and program environments, teach and learn
      through Samskrita, and continue to find my voice through
      platforms like Toastmasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m curious about how structure and softness coexist —
      in work, leadership, and life.
      This blog is an extension of that curiosity.
