    <h1>Leadership Without a Title</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Small actions teach leadership beyond positions.</p>

    <p>One of the most important lessons I learned is that leadership isn’t about roles or titles. It’s about influence, empathy, and consistent actions.</p>

    <p>In a project crisis, I noticed a junior taking initiative quietly, helping peers, and resolving blockers. No title, no formal authority—yet the team followed because of trust and clarity.</p>

    <p>Leadership can exist anywhere, as long as you act responsibly and thoughtfully.</p>

    <p class="takeaway">True leaders inspire by actions, not by designations.</p>
