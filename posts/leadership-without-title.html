    <h1>Leadership Without a Title</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Influence grows quietly — through reliability, not authority.</p>

    <p>
      Early in my career, I noticed colleagues stepping up, solving problems, and helping others 
      without any formal title. Meanwhile, people in positions often didn’t inspire trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      One project deadline was looming. A team member volunteered to document processes, 
      organize handoffs, and guide others. I didn’t ask. No one promoted them. Yet the impact was huge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership isn’t always about authority. It’s about consistency, ownership, and 
      showing up when it matters.
    </p>

    <p class="takeaway">
      Leadership can exist anywhere — you don’t need a title to make a difference.
