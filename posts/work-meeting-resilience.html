  <h1>The Project Didn’t Fail in the Meeting</h1>

  <p>The meeting went well.</p>

  <p>
    Everyone agreed. Ready nods, timelines looked aligned, and the next steps
    were captured in neat bullet points. There was no tension in the room,
    no red flags raised, no sense that anything was about to go wrong.
  </p>

  <p>The project didn’t fail there.</p>

  <p>
    It failed earlier — quietly — in a dependency no one wrote down.
  </p>

  <h2>Where it actually broke</h2>

  <p>
    In one of my projects, we were moving fast. Multiple teams, parallel tracks,
    shared ownership. On paper, the plan looked solid.
  </p>

  <p>
    But one task depended on another finishing first.<br>
    Not formally. Not technically.<br>
    Just in reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    That dependency lived in someone’s head — not in the plan, not in the tracker,
    not in the risk log. Because everyone “knew” it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Except we didn’t align timelines around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So when upstream work slipped slightly, downstream work didn’t adjust.
    The task wasn’t flagged as blocked. It wasn’t raised as a risk.
    It simply… didn’t happen on time.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time we noticed, it was already a problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Why we didn’t see it as a risk</h2>

  <p>
    The interesting part is this:<br>
    nothing felt risky at the time.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The task existed</li>
    <li>The owner was assigned</li>
    <li>The date was filled in</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    What was missing was the <em>relationship</em> between tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    We tend to log risks when something feels uncertain or external.
    This didn’t feel like either. It felt internal, controllable, obvious.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why it never made it to the risk register.
  </p>

  <h2>The lesson I didn’t learn from a template</h2>

  <p>
    What this taught me wasn’t about better tools or stricter processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Work fails less because of what we don’t plan<br>
    and more because of what we assume doesn’t need saying.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Dependencies aren’t just technical.<br>
    They are conversational.
  </p>

  <p>
    If they aren’t spoken, written, and revisited,
    they don’t really exist — no matter how “obvious” they seem.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do differently now</h2>

  <p>
    I don’t just ask what the tasks are.
  </p>

  <p>I ask:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What cannot start until something else finishes?</li>
    <li>What will silently slip if one date moves?</li>
    <li>What does this task depend on that isn’t written anywhere?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And if the answer starts with “It’s obvious…” — that’s where I slow down.
  </p>

  <p>The project didn’t fail in the meeting.</p>

  <p>
    It failed in the space between two tasks that were never properly connected.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s where most projects actually break.
