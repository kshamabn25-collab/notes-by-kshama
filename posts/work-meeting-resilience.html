    <h1>The Meeting That Looked Perfect on Slides</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A quiet lesson in reading what dashboards don’t say.</p>

    <p>
      The deck was flawless. Green indicators everywhere.
      Risks logged, dependencies mapped, timelines aligned.

      Answers were careful, not confident.
    </p>

    <p>
      That meeting taught me something no framework did —
      projects speak through people, not charts.
