  <p>
    The project didn’t fail in the meeting.
    That’s just where it became visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    In one project, the issue was deceptively small.
    We missed noting down a dependency.
  </p>

  <p>
    It wasn’t dramatic.
    No one ignored their work.
    No one consciously cut corners.
  </p>

  <p>
    A task depended on an input from another stream.
    Both teams had timelines.
    They just weren’t aligned.
  </p>

  <p>
    On paper, each plan made sense on its own.
    Together, they didn’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because the dependency wasn’t explicitly captured,
    it never showed up as a risk.
    There was nothing to track.
    Nothing to escalate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Weeks passed.
    Each team moved forward,
    assuming the other was aligned.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the dependent task finally came due,
    the input wasn’t ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when the questions started.
    Why wasn’t this flagged?
    Why didn’t we see this coming?
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking back, the signs were there.
    They just never crossed paths in the same conversation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The miss wasn’t in execution.
    It was in articulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    A dependency not written down
    becomes a dependency no one owns.
  </p>

  <p>
    And a dependency no one owns
    rarely becomes a risk —
    until it becomes a delay.
  </p>

  <p class="takeaway">
    The project didn’t break because of a missed task.
    It broke because of a missed connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    That experience changed how I work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I pay closer attention to what sits between plans —
    the handoffs, the assumptions, the quiet “we thought they had it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Most project issues don’t start as problems.
    They start as unnamed dependencies.
