    <h1>Learning to Pause in a World That Rewards Speed</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Leadership is often found in small, quiet moments.</p>

    <p>
      I used to rush through feedback sessions, trying to cover all points in 10 minutes. 
      One day, a student asked a question that stopped me in my tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of answering quickly, I paused. Let the silence sit. Let them think. 
      The response that came was far better than any prepared line I could have given.
    </p>

    <p>
      That week became a lesson in restraint. Teaching isn’t about speed; it’s about creating space 
      for learning to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every day since, I’ve remembered: pausing allows reflection, depth, and true understanding.
    </p>

    <p class="takeaway">
      Pausing didn’t slow me down — it let learning happen.
