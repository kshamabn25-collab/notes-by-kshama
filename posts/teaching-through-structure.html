    <h1>Teaching Through Structure</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">How structured approaches reveal hidden lessons.</p>

    <p>Mentoring juniors and guiding peers taught me one key lesson: structure matters. Not to control, but to free people to focus on what’s important.</p>

    <p>One session I ran involved a complex workflow. Initially, the team felt constrained. But once we followed a clear structure, the discussions became richer, questions deeper, and solutions more thoughtful.</p>

    <p>Structure isn’t about rigidity; it’s about creating space for creativity and reflection.</p>

    <p class="takeaway">Guiding others is often best done through frameworks, not directives.</p>
