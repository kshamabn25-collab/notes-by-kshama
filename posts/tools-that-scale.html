    <h1>Tools That Scale</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">From PMO trackers to daily routines—what keeps me organized.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve tried dozens of tools—spreadsheets, dashboards, project trackers, and personal habit apps. Some were complex, some simple. The ones that lasted were those that scaled with the problem, not added more overhead.</p>

    <p>I learned to use a mix of digital and analog: a daily to-do list, a weekly review, and a few core dashboards. Simplicity mattered more than bells and whistles.</p>

    <p class="takeaway">Tools are only as good as the habits and discipline behind them.</p>
