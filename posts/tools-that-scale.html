    <h1>Simple Tools That Scale</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Complexity doesn’t scale — simplicity does.</p>

    <p>
      When I started managing multiple projects, I tried to use every tool recommended online. 
      Spreadsheets, dashboards, trackers, automation platforms… the list went on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Confusion grew faster than clarity. Deadlines slipped. Teams were frustrated. 
      Then I simplified: one spreadsheet, one tracker, one consistent daily routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, work flowed. Communication improved. Transparency returned. 
      Fancy tools were impressive, but simple tools scaled far better in reality.
    </p>

    <p class="takeaway">
      Clear templates and habits outperform fancy platforms every time.
