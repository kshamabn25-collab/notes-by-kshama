    <h1>Finding My Voice Before Confidence</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Lessons from Toastmasters and teaching.</p>

    <p>
      Confidence didn’t arrive first. Voice did.
      Through teaching, speaking, and standing in front of learners.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership grew quietly — through preparation,
      presence, and listening more than speaking.
    </p>

    <p class="takeaway">
      Leadership often begins before you feel ready.
