    <h1>Learning Career Pivots</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">How project shifts taught me adaptability.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, projects take unexpected turns. A sudden client change, a vendor delay, or an internal restructure—it can throw the best-laid plans off balance.</p>

    <p>I remember a project where half the resources shifted mid-way. Panic was the first reaction, but soon I realized this was an opportunity to learn. We re-prioritized, adjusted deliverables, and I learned how flexibility can be more valuable than rigid planning.</p>

    <p>Pivoting is not about giving up control; it’s about seeing options you didn’t notice before.</p>

    <p class="takeaway">True growth comes when you learn to dance with change rather than fight it.</p>
