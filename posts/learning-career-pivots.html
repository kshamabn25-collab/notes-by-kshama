    <h1>When the Plan Wasn’t the Problem</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Execution fails quietly before it fails visibly.</p>

    <p>
      During a product rollout, everything looked perfect: timelines aligned, resources confirmed, risks identified. 
      And yet, the delivery struggled. The dashboards showed green, but progress stalled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversations revealed misaligned expectations. Teams were competent but disconnected. The plan was solid; 
      execution wasn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent the week shadowing teams, listening to frustrations and informal knowledge sharing. 
      Slowly, small miscommunications resolved. Work flowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The realization was simple: strategy and plans are only part of the picture. Listening and observing 
      on the ground matters more than perfection on paper.

    <p class="takeaway">
      Execution fails quietly, long before it fails visibly.
