    <h1>The Meeting That Looked Fine on Paper</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A quiet lesson from a moment I didn’t expect to matter.</p>

    <p>
      It was a Monday morning, the calendar full of back-to-back meetings. 
      My coffee had gone cold, and the project sync was supposed to be routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Halfway through, I noticed tension in the room. Everyone nodded politely, 
      but the questions were safe, the smiles faint. The plan looked perfect on slides, 
      yet something felt off.
    </p>

    <p>
      I stopped presenting and started listening. Observing instead of speaking, 
      noting subtleties in tone and timing. That day, the PMO’s real work 
      became visible: building trust, not enforcing processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I realized the value of these quiet observations. A report alone never changes outcomes — 
      relationships and subtle influence do.

    <p class="takeaway">
      Some lessons don’t arrive as feedback — they arrive as silence.
