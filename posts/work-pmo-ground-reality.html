  <h1>What PMO Looks Like on the Ground</h1>
  <p class="meta">January 2026</p>

  <p>
    PMO work is often described through frameworks and governance models.
    In practice, it looks far more human.
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of the real value comes from coordination, clarity,
    and removing friction — not from documentation alone.
  </p>

  <h2>What actually matters</h2>
  <p>
    Trust, rhythm, and consistency matter more than tools.
    A good PMO enables work rather than controlling it.
