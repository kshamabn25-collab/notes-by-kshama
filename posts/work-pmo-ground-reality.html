    <h1>The Meeting That Looked Fine on Paper</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A quiet lesson from a routine PMO meeting.</p>

    <p>It was a Monday morning, and the calendar was full of back-to-back meetings. My coffee had gone cold, but the project sync was supposed to be routine.</p>

    <p>Halfway through, I noticed tension in the room. Everyone nodded politely, but the questions were safe, the smiles faint. The plan looked perfect on slides, yet something felt off.</p>

    <p>I stopped presenting and started observing instead. Listening, noting subtleties in tone and timing. That day, I realized that PMO work isn’t just about schedules or reports—it’s about trust and relationships.</p>

    <p>Over time, I understood the value of these quiet observations. Reports and dashboards rarely capture the true pulse of a project.</p>

    <p class="takeaway">Some lessons don’t arrive as feedback—they arrive as silence.</p>
